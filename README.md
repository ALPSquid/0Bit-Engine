0Bit-Engine
===========

LibGDX based game engine (currently a concept)

- Based on LibGDX including its back-end practices
- Should easily manage (using singletons):
	- Screens
	- Assets
	- Rendering 
	- Debugging overlays and renderers
	- World (incorporate deltatime)
	- Input (including Controller support)
	- GUIs
	- Actors (static, dynamic) use Ashley?
	- Particles
	- Logging(?) (wrapper for the inbuilt LibGDX logging system)
	- Physics (Box2D option)
	- Collision Detection (simple: custom, advanced: Box2D)
