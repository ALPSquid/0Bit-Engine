Physics/Movement System
This part of the engine needs some serious planning

    MovmentSystem
	- Movement (which works best for gravity and stacking velocities. Look at some examples):
	    A) Altering velocity and have MovementSystem call moveBy
	    B) Calling moveBy directly
	- Jumping
	    - Jump time? Gravity offset?
	
    ZbeGame Loop
	- Learn and implement a Fixed TimeStep delta time based game loop (FlashPunk as 2 options)


--- Implementation --- 

Base Game:
	Enable/disable fixed timestep on startup. 
	30 ticks per second game loop

Movement or Rendering System
	Check if FixedTimestep is enabled, if yes, movement is x units per frame otherwise movement is x units per second (times by deltatime)

MovementSystem
	Track position, velocity, acceleration
	Problem: to overcome gravity to a decent height, I have to set the jump velocity to something ludicrous/s which has the effect of the player teleporting

	Jumping: Increase velocity by jumpPower. Decrease velocity by gravity every tick
	Gravity should be based on the tick rate
